# flask-salary-predictor
This is project predicts the salary of the employee based on the experience. This web app is a part of my learning projects. It shows the fast way to embed ML model to web framework. We can see how inputs are sent from user to ML model. We can start usting this as a base to learn to install more advanced application of ML model in the future.

# Model

# Server
server.py contains all the requiered for flask and to manage APIs.
